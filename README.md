# 🤖 What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering means writing clear and smart instructions (prompts) to tell an AI what to do.
It helps you “talk” to AI so it gives you the best answers.

#💡 Why It’s Important

You don’t need to code.

Clear prompts give better results.

Practice improves accuracy.

It’s a key skill for working faster and smarter.

# ⚙️ Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

Prompt Engineering: How you ask the AI to do something.

Context Engineering: What information you show the AI to help it answer correctly.

 # 🧩 How They Work Together
Prompt = How you ask
Context = What you show
Together, they make the AI smart and reliable.

 # 🧠 Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs (like ChatGPT) are trained to predict the next word in a sentence.
They don’t think like humans.
They use patterns learned from large text data.

⚙️ How They Work (Simple)

You type a prompt.

The AI predicts the next word.

It repeats until it forms a complete answer.

It learns from millions of examples it studied before.
