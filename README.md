🎓 Quarter 04 — First Class (10-10-2025)

# 🤖 What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering means writing clear and smart instructions (prompts) to tell an AI what to do.
It helps you “talk” to AI so it gives you the best answers.

#💡 Why It’s Important

You don’t need to code.

Clear prompts give better results.

Practice improves accuracy.

It’s a key skill for working faster and smarter.

# ⚙️ Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

Prompt Engineering: How you ask the AI to do something.

Context Engineering: What information you show the AI to help it answer correctly.

 # 🧩 How They Work Together
Prompt = How you ask
Context = What you show
Together, they make the AI smart and reliable.

 # 🧠 Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs (like ChatGPT) are trained to predict the next word in a sentence.
They don’t think like humans.
They use patterns learned from large text data.

⚙️ How They Work (Simple)

You type a prompt.

The AI predicts the next word.

It repeats until it forms a complete answer.

It learns from millions of examples it studied before.

# practice of the day 01
Act as a professional AI expert.
Help me understand the impact of AI on future jobs.
I am a web developer and curious about how AI will change work in tech and other fields.
Write the answer in three clear paragraphs using simple, easy-to-understand language.
Include real-life examples.
Keep the total length around 400 words.

## DAY 02
## A. Fundamental Prompting Techniques

These are the foundation for how we communicate with AI.

# 1. Zero-shot prompting
You ask the question directly with no examples.
Example: “Explain how blockchain works in simple terms.”
The AI uses only its training knowledge to answer.
Use this when the task is simple or factual.

2. One-shot prompting
You show the AI one example to teach the pattern.
Example:
“Example: Translate this to French – Hello = Bonjour. Now translate Good Morning.”
This helps the AI learn your format.

3. Few-shot prompting
You give multiple examples before your real question.
Example:
“Example 1: Question: What is AI? Answer: Artificial Intelligence is…
Example 2: Question: What is ML? Answer: Machine Learning is…
Now, Question: What is NLP?”
Few-shot improves consistency and tone because the AI mimics your samples.

4. System prompting
You define how the AI should behave globally.
Example: “You are an academic writing assistant who writes concise and professional summaries.”
System prompts control style, role, and boundaries of behavior.

5. Role prompting
You tell the model to act as an expert.
Example: “Act as a senior data scientist and explain model overfitting.”
This triggers domain-specific knowledge and tone.

6. Contextual prompting
You give background information before the task.
Example: “Here’s a short article about renewable energy. Summarize it in 3 bullet points.”
This adds grounding so the answer stays relevant and factual.
